                                I've been playing video games since I was ~4 years old.
                                <br>
                                I've mostly spent time playing Arena-like and Tactical shooters like Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.
                                <br>
                                I'm better than most at motor skills, quick decision-making, and team play.

                                I also have some experience creating various redstone machines in Minecraft.
